Data Science and Machine Learning Projects: 

# Welcome to my GitHub repository

You'll find a collection of repositories that showcase my skills and progress in Data Science, Machine Learning, and related fields. 
These projects reflect my journey from foundational concepts to more advanced techniques, integrating my knowledge in Python, data analytics, machine learning, and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs).

About Me:
I am currently pursuing my MTech in Data Science at the renowned NMIMS Deemed to be University, Mumbai.
I am aiming to make contributions in the field of MLAI and DS. My goal is to master data science concepts and utilize ML and Deep Learning in saviours sectors of medical sciences and finance.
I am particularly interested in topics like Generative Adversarial Networks, Computer Vision - (Object Detection, Image Classification, Segmentation), Deep Learning for Medical Science.
